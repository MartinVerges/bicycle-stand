## Why?

My family consists of 5 people, 2 adults as well as 3 children. When I bought my motorhome, it was still ok to push the small children's bike in the trunk of the motorhome.
After not too long, however, this led to more and more problems.

In addition, the previously and originally mounted Thule carrier was apparently not designed stable enough to hold the bikes.
Even worse, however, I found that the bikes scrape against each other and thereby increasingly damaged.

## How damaged was the orginial?

I think a picture is worth a thousand words.

It happend while we where driving on a regular road at around 70-80km/h.
As you can see ob the picture, we had 2 bicycle for adults and 2 bicycle for kids mounted.
This should in no way result in an overload situation.

## The Design

After much thought and some trial and error, I decided on the simplest possible design.
The airline rails used serve as a holder and transfer the weight of the wheels to the rear wall.
Since I dislike having holes and thus potential leaks in my motorhome, I opted for a glued version.
Yes, really this is just glued!

The bicycle racks from the manufacturer EUFab are then mounted on these cross rails.
For this purpose, it was necessary to saw an aluminum L-profile to size and drill the desired holes in each case.

## BOM - Bill of Materials

To build this bicycle rack yourself, you need:

 * 2x [2m Airline rail glueable](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07SJDD22G/)
 * 1x [10x screw fitting 30mm](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07Y5NTNS2/)
 * 10x Stop nuts stainless steel (if not included in the screw fitting)
 * 1x [10x Slot Nut for Airline Rails M6](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08Y5SQM54/)
 * 5x [EUFAB 12015 Bicycle stand ALU STAR](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0012M7O2W/)
 * 5x Aluminum L-profile unequal 50x10x3mm cut from a 1m bar
 * 2x [Sikaflex-552 Primerless Hybrid Assembly Adhesive](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00QF3X378/)

_Note: Tools are needed for shortening tubes, sawing off aluminum profiles and the like!_

## Steps to execute

#### Step 1:
Obtain materials.
Make sure you have all the necessary components and materials.

#### Step 2:
Measure the exact location where you want to mount your bike rack.
Keep in mind that the bikes should protrude over the rail and not cover license plates, lights or other important parts of your vehicle.
In general, I recommend mounting as low as possible, as this will make it easier to mount the bikes later.

#### Step 3:
Clean the back of your motorhome thoroughly.
In the last step after cleaning, you should degrease the surface.
Also degrease the adhesive side of the airline rail.

#### Step 4:
Apply the correct amount of adhesive to the airline rail and put on the correct position.
Please refer to the package insert or imprint of your adhesive for the quantity or usage instructions.

#### Step 5:
Wait until the adhesive is fully cured.
This can take 24 hours or up to a week.

#### Step 6:
Mount the bike holders on the airline rails.

### Note:
Do not worry, if the special construction adhesive is properly applied, it will hold the rails, any bike, and also much heavier loads.
It is almost impossible to disassemble this rail ever again from the motorhome!
Please be sure BEFORE that you have the right position and that you want to mount in place.

## Field report:

We have the bike holder already for well over 10,000 km in the practical test over hill and dale.
The bikes are extremely firmly mounted on the stand, nothing wobbles and it holds excellent.

## Bicycle assembly procedure:

Initially, we have the bikes mounted in pairs.
This is generally the easiest, of course.
After a short practice, I can easily mount the bikes alone.

To do this, I roll with the bike on the rear wheel to my camper and operate the rear brake as soon as I am in position.
Now I grab the bike to lift it and roll it with the front wheel in the rail upwards.
When I reach the desired position, I apply the front brake and hold the bike in position.
With the other hand, I can now fold up the bracket, readjust it and then roughly turn it shut.
Then I fix the wheels with the straps and make sure that the screws are properly tightened.
