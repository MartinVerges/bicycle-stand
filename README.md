## Why?

My family consists of 5 people, 2 adults as well as 3 children. When I bought my motorhome, it was still ok to push the small children's bike in the trunk of the motorhome.
After not too long, however, this led to more and more problems.

In addition, the previously and originally mounted Thule carrier was apparently not designed stable enough to hold the bikes.
Even worse, however, I found that the bikes scrape against each other and thereby increasingly damaged.

## How damaged was the orginial?

I think a picture is worth a thousand words.

It happend while we where driving on a regular road at around 70-80km/h.
As you can see ob the picture, we had 2 bicycle for adults and 2 bicycle for kids mounted.
This should in no way result in an overload situation.

## The Design

After much thought and some trial and error, I decided on the simplest possible design.
The airline rails used serve as a holder and transfer the weight of the wheels to the rear wall.
Since I dislike having holes and thus potential leaks in my motorhome, I opted for a glued version.
Yes, really this is just glued!

The bicycle racks from the manufacturer EUFab are then mounted on these cross rails.
For this purpose, it was necessary to saw an aluminum L-profile to size and drill the desired holes in each case.
